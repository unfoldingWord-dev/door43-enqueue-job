# Run the tests first
#  and if they succeed, make the docker image(s)
#   (and check that both succeed)
script:
  - PYTHONPATH="enqueue/" coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests/

# Only execute the following instructions in the case of a success
#  (failing at this point won't mark the build as a failure).
# To have `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` filled
#  you need to either use `travis`' cli and then `travis set ..`
#  or go to the travis page of your repository
#  and then change the environment in the settings pannel.
